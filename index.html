<p>Hi! My name is Tayanna Lemons,a rising senior in high school. I've been playing volleyball for four years and have truly found a passion for the game. Since I love the game so much I want to have the chance to help others learn how to play. To start off you will need: volleyball or basketball shoes,<!DOCTYPE html>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Beginners</h3>

<p>As a beginner you wil need to learn how to pass the ball. In volleyball, passing is called bumping. So, as you watch the video below you will learn the basics of bumping. <html>

    Serving is also a skill everyone needs to learn. Unless serving is a big weakness of yours, everyone will have to serve at some point. So, you can learn the general form and technique that goes into serving below.

<p>A more challenging task to take on is hitting. A lot of people say the taller people on the team is more cut out for it but anyone can do it. Hitting is really different form bumping, but a big skill for any volleyball player to learn.

    Now, setting is an evenn harder task to accomplish. Setter is one of the hardest positions but the general form/technique is not that hard.
